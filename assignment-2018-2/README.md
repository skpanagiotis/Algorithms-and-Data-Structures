# 2nd Assignment

## Intro
 
This program construct a **Graeco-Latin square**.

 ## Latin square
 
 A Latin square is a table *nxn* containing *n* different symbols, so that each one appears only once, in a single row and in a single column.

 ## Rectangular Latin Squares

 If we have a Latin square, then we can try to find a Latin square with the same elements, arranged so that if we get an element from the first square and an element from the second square, the pair that is formed does not appear anywhere else. Two such Latin squares are called Rectangular Latin Squares.

 ## Graeco-Latin Square

 If we combine two Rectangular Latin Squares so that we get a new square with each element containing the corresponding element of the other two squares, we get A Graeco-Latin square.

## Description

 The purpose of the program is, given a Latin square, to costruct the Graeco-Latin square resulting from it.

 The process of executing the program is:

 1. Clone the repository
 2. cd `../assignment-2018-2`
 3. Type `python gr-la-square.py <input_file>`

 Some Latin squares for example:
+ [4x4](./4x4.txt)
+ [5x5](./5x5.txt)
+ [6x6](./6x6.txt)
+ [10x10](./10x10.txt)
